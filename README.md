# Volatiltiy-Calculation-Methods
Comparing Methods of Calculating Stock Historic Volatility (Visualized)


This Project Compares 2 methods of calculating volatiltiy.
1. Standard Deviation Calculation    2. EWMA (Exponetial Weighted Moving Average) Calculation

The St. Dv. model weighs the past volatiltiy no matter how recent all equally. High volatilty recently is weighed the same as lower voaltity many months ago. 

The EWMA model weights past volatilty in respect to recency. The more recent values of volatitliy have a stronger impact on the current volatiltiy than points from many days ago.
